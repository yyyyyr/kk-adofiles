Programs I have found useful for one thing or another...

# Workflow #

Aside from Econometrics packages (R, Stata, SAS, Matlab, etc.), spreadsheets, and word processing,
these three programs are at the heart of what I do every day. I never close Notepad++ or the TortoiseHG workbench.

  * **[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net)** - A good Text Editor.  Better than Stata's built-in editor.  (see [my notes](http://code.google.com/p/notepad-stats-integration/) on how to use with Stata)
  * **[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)** and **[TortoiseHG](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/)** - Revision control.  Essential.  Easily track every stage of your research.  It's also fantastic for working with coauthors. Here's a little reading on the subject:`*`
    * [Introduction to Revision Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/)
    * [Distributed Revision Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated/)
    * [Another introduction](http://hginit.com/)
    * [Some comments I wrote](http://www.michaelnormanmitchell.com/stow/ssc-help-files-over-the-internet.html?lastPage=true#comment12622222)
    * TortoiseHG is a "Point and Click" software that has Mercurial built into it.  Git is a similar program, with similar features.
  * **Online backup** - This is an essential investment for any graduate student, or anyone else. This has saved me multiple from computer problems and my own mistakes.
    * [Jungledisk](http://www.jungledisk.com) - backup to Amazon S3.
    * I keep copies of all Mercrial repositories online.  Every time I commit, my work gets pushed to other computers for backup.  You can use your own server and/or keep copies on private (free) repositories like [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com)

# Utilities #

These are programs I have found useful for one thing or another.

  * [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/) - Automate anything in Windows
  * [CSVed](http://csved.sjfrancke.nl/) - CSV file editor
  * [Drupal](http://drupal.org) - Website CMS
  * [MiniTrue](http://www.idiotsdelight.net/minitrue/) - Text file utility (including find/replace) from command line
  * [Nod32](http://www.eset.com) - Antivirus
  * [PDF Creator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/) - PDF Distiller
  * [WinSCP](http://www.winscp.net/) - SFTP client using SSH
  * [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) - Research tool in Firefox, bibliography and citation manager

`*`[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is similar to Mercurial. It is a little more like a Swiss-army knife. Mercurial is eassier to use for simple projects with only a few authors. That said, it's not a big deal to use both.
