I have posted some "feeds" I created for [Ubiquity](http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/ubiquity/).

[Ubiquity](http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/ubiquity) is a package that
can be added to [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/) and enhance the user-interface of your
browser. I think it is best described with this video: [Ubiquity for Firefox](http://vimeo.com/1561578)

For a while, I used these feeds all the time.
As of 3/2011, Ubiquity does not work in the current version of Firefox.
Given the choice of Firefox 4 or Ubiquity, I went with the browser.
Therefore, it doesn't work on my computer and I've stopped using it.
That means I probably won't publish any more feeds.

Firefox might automatically detect the file if you have Ubiquity is installed.
If not, download this file:
